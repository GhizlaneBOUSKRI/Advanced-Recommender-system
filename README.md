# Recommender-system-ML

Two most common types of recommender systems are Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering (CF).
Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of usersâ€™ attitude to items, that is it uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items.
Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

The Data
I use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.
